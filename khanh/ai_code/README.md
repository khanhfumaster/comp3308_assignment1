K-Nearest Neighbour, Naive Bayes and 10-fold stratified cross validation

Instructions
----
To run the Python script to run 10-fold cross validation with k-NN (k=1 and k=5) and Naive Bayes, run:
```sh
python ai_main.py <FILENAME>
```

**Example**
```sh
python ai_main.py pima.csv
python ai_main.py pima-CFS.csv
```

This should output pima-folds.csv and pima-CFS-folds.csv respectively.
